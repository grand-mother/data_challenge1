#ZHAireS-Specific
#removes from the fresnel time output the vector potential and the antena positions, leaving only antena number, time and electric field components

#creates an additional CoREAS compatible output

#We make the Antenna time window tight to reduce output. Be sure to tune it for your needs. This should give on output 4096 points, a nice power of 2.
#The Antenna time window is set by the antenna positions generator.
